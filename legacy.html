        <h2> His Legacy </h2>
        <br>
        <div id="legacy">
            <p> His contributions to the founding of the United States can still be seen to this day, his photo adorns the $10 note and 
                the publishing company he established, the New York Post, is still operational today.
                Following his death, his widow 'Eliza' established New York's first private orphanage, an homage to Hamilton's childhood. 
                This orphanage is still running today under a different name - the Graham Windham organization. </p> 
                <br>
            <h3> 'Alexander Hamilton' by Ron Chernow </h3>
                <br>
            <p> Hamilton's legacy was documented in the 2004 biography written by Pulitzer Award-winning historian and biographer, Ron Chernow.
                Good reads writes that 'Chernow here recounts Hamilton’s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came
                out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington’s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army,
                coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first
                Treasury Secretary of the United States'. His success in documenting his life led to Chernow becoming a historical consultant for the musical adaptation. </p>
                <br>
            
                    <h3> The musical adaptation </h3>
                <br>
                    <p> The world-renowned musical composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda features a mixture of hip hop, R&B, soul and pop musical numbers.
                        It took 7 years for the production to be composed and it debuted off-broadway in 2015. 
                        The musical would later win a staggering 11 awards (including Best Musical) at the 70th annual Tony awards.
                    </p>

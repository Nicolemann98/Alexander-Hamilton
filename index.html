          <br />
          <p>
            Hamilton is most famous for being one of America's founding fathers,
            alongside the likes of Geroge Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Prior
            to this, however, he was an orphaned clerk in the Caribbean.
            Following his move to North America in 1772, he began his education
            in New York - allowing him to become a supporter of a Revolution
            against British rule. In the late 1770's he joined the military and
            began fighting in the Revolutionary War in order to gain
            independence from the Imperial rule of Britain.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Following the aftermath of the war, Hamilton began a successful
            legal and political career, he passed the bar in New York in 1782
            and was selected as NY delegate for the Continental Congress.
            Serving under Washington's administration, he became Secretary of
            the Treasury and estabished the Bank of New York. His political
            career came to an end in 1795 following the scandal of his
            adulterous affair - he would pass away in 1804 from a gunshot wound
            sustained in a duel against his rival, Aaron Burr.
